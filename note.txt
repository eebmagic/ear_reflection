General process:
    - track sound "ray" from source point
    - find faces that the ray collides with
        - currently most uncertain on how to do this
        Process:
            - draw line from source to each surface
            - throw out lines obstructed by other faces
                - (point on a face is within window of points making that face)
    - make new ray that is the reflection of that ray off of the ear face
        - should have decreased amplitude from sound absorbed by ear flesh
        - new ray should originate from reflected position of source through the face
    - claculate sound of each ray hitting the "ear drum"
        - consider the total distance traveled by a ray including bouncing in the ear
        - use final amplitude of each ray after all bounces off of ear
        - use total distance / speed of sound & final amplitude to find the point in sound file and intensity to play it
        - final amplitude:
            final_amp = original_amp * (damping_const ^ num_of_bounces)
    - Add all final ray inputs together
        - not entirely sure how this would work
    - Save final generated wave to an output file
